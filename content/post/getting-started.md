A few days ago I read the following tweet somewhere on the internet !!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function<br><br>When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post</p>&mdash; David Robinson (@drob) <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

I tried to relate it to my real life experience and it definitely did make a lot of sense. I have seen myself sometimes repeating and sharing the same advice with my friends and colleagues. So, I decided to start my own blog to share my learnings and experiences with everyone. 

I enjoy reading and have become an avid reader (I would have been surprised if someone said that about me a couple of years ago). 
I love to read about a lot of varied topics and yes anything related to the computers (we go long way back) and the technology. Currently, I am more occupied with reading academic texts and papers about topics of my interests and I would love to share anything I find interesting in them. Apart from reading, I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with people which is the main motivation behind this blog.

Talking to people who are new to the field or are nervous because of the initial experience with something and helping them is something I have always cherished. **"Success is not counted by how high you have climbed but by how many people you brought with you".**And I try to stand by this each and every day of my life. I do sometimes digress to philosophy even when I try very hard not to, I promise I would avoid it in the future posts :) But, coming back to the purpose of this blog and the interests that I would like to talk about here.  

I find currently find the areas of *machine learning and distributed systems* very fascinating. I would love to share my perspective about different concepts and try to make topics in those areas more interesting and understandable.

I recently read an article which talked about why *deep learning*, I apologize for the jargon. Let's for now not focus on what does it mean as it's not that important at the moment. The article said that the fact that deep learning is hyped is itself hyped. I agree with it as people are trying to make use of buzzwords to gain traction and there is nothing wrong with that. My point is, yes, it may be hyped, but what differentiates a genuine enthusiast and person who wants to make use of any form of science and technology is not how much hype one can create, it's about how much impact one can have with their creation over the world and its population. This is the sole reason behind my curiosity about machine learning and distributed systems. I think they are very useful and if people try to make use of them to solve real-world problems, the opportunities are endless !!  

I might sometimes write about some non-technical topics also, but yes I would try to keep them separate. I have found the internet and online communities very useful for the knowledge I have gained in my life. **This is my way to give something back to it !!** I hope this blog would be useful for everyone and I would love to hear your comments and feedback.

Stay tuned !!!
